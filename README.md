**main content**
The data are presented here as an Excel file that contains **23 worksheets** in total.
After a discography [worksheet 1] that identifies all available recordings of the work (91) and the subgroup of those analyzed in the PETAL project (55), the following two worksheet contain the main information on the whole cycle of six pieces: the **absolute duration** (of each piece and the entire cycle) for each recording and the **percentage** of the total duration for each piece [worksheet 2] and the **main tempo** (mean bpm values excluding passages with tempo changes prescribed in the score) as well as the **relative standard deviation** for the tempo of each piece in each analyzed recording [worksheet 3]. These data are provide in five different selections off 55, 46, 41 (S57a), 41 (S63), and 40 recordings respectively:
* **55 recordings** include 43 recordings made between 1925 and 2013, all of which have been published except for two out of sex recordings by Eduard Steuermann which we obtained from archives, three studio recordings made by three pianists associated with the PETAL project in January/February 2018, as well as nine recordings by the same PETAL-associated pianist (three by each pianist) during a workshop in March 2018.
* **46 recordings** include the entire corpus except for the nine workshop recordings.
* **41 recordings** in addition reduce the six recordings by Eduard Steuermann to only one (Steuermann 1957a and Steuermann 1963 respectively).
* **40 recordings** exclude all Steuermann recordings.

[Woksheets 2 and 3] are provided in tsv-format in addition.

[Worksheet 4] compares the data of all six Steuermann recordings with each other as well as with the data of the 40 recordings by other pianists. 
[Worksheet 5] compares the data of the four recordings of each PETAL-associated pianist (twelve recordings in total) with each other as well as with the data of 41, 46, and 55 corpora.

[Worksheets 6-23] provide detailed tempo data for each piece including the calculationof mean tempi and standard deviation values. For each piece the corpora 55, 41 (S57a), and 412 (S63) are provided.
